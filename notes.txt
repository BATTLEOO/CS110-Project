1. For each problem, provide in more than 100 words, a short, high-level description of the problem;
your approach to solve it; and any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve them.

Problem 1 (Reverse): 1. read all strings from standard input into a list a
                     2. use for loop, set i in range from 0 to n / 2, which n / 2 is not included
                     3. using swap method to exchange a[i] with a[n − i −1]
                     4. use for loop, set i in range from 0 to n, n is not included
                            a) in the inner, write if statement, if i is less than n - 1, if True, write a[i] with a space after in standard output
                            b) write else statement, write a[i] with a newline after in standard output

Problem 2 (Euclidean Distance): 1. set n as int arguments, n is the number of input we want to have
                                2. create an empty list x, list x used to store the number we want to calculate
                                3. use for loop, set the range from 0 to n, n is not included
                                        a) set a value to store the user input to float, by using stdio.readFloat()
                                        b) Append the value, we add the value to the end of the list, because the list is empty, so the first append value will be the first value in the list
                                4. create a y list that is empty
                                5. create a for loop that is the same idea form x
                                        a) set the value 2 to read the user input
                                        b) Append the value on by one from the user input
                                6. set distance to 0.0 (float)
                                5. set range from i to n, n not include
                                        a) Increment distance by (x[i] − y[i]) ** 2
                                6. after we get the value that from the for loop, we write distance in sqrt in standard output

Problem 3 (Birthday Problem): 1. Set DAYS_PER_YEAR to 365
                              2. Create trials as int argument
                              3. Set count to
                              4. write for loop in range from 0 to trials, trials do no include
                                        a) Set birthdaysSeen to a list of size DAYS_PER_YEAR, and make all the value to False
                                        b) set the while loop to True, make the loop run forever
                                                i) Increment count by 1, to count the birthday
                                                i) Set birthday to a random int from 0 to DAY_PER_YEAR(not include)
                                                i) Write an if statement if we the value is true we break
                                                        v) Write the break statement
                                                        v) If we do not see the birthday before, we move into the else statement assign the True value in the current location
                              5. Write count / trials in standard output, remember we want a floor division, so we use //

Problem 4 (Transpose): 1. set m and n as int arguments
                       2. Create an m * n list, and set the value to None
                       3. set for loop i in range from 0 to m(not include), this is row

                                            b) Set a[i][j] to a float read from standard input, I set value1 to store the input
                                            c) assign value1 to a[i][j]
                       4. Create an n ×m list c, elements to None, it is a 2d list
                       5. Create for loop i in range from 0 to n(not include)

Problem 7 (Playing the Waltz): 1. readAllInts is already a list, store our input in measures
                               2. write an if statement if the input is no equal to 32 -- also use len(measures) to check the number of input, if not equal to 32, print the message by using sys.exit()
                                            a) write the message if not equal to 32
                               3. write for i in range from measures[0] to measures[15], because we want to check the first 16 value is from minuet measure
                                            a) write if statement , if is not between 1 and 176
                                                    i) if not , we print a status say it must between 1 and 176
                               4. write for loop i in range form 16 to 32 the last 16 elements that we want to access
                                            a) we use if statement to check is the value between 1 and 96
                                                    i) if not between, we print a status say it must between 1 and 96
                               5. set a for loop v in range from [0] to [15], we want at to have the first 16 value
                                            a) we store the value in waltz each time
                                            b) we set the file name , filename = 'data/M' + str(minuet)
                                            c) we use stdaudio.playFile to play the music which choose from M.wav
                               6. set a for loop v in range from [16] to [31], we want at to have the last 16 value
                                            a) we store the value in trio each time
                                            b) we set the file name, filename = 'data/T' + str(trio)
                                            c) we use stdaudio.playFile to play the music which choose from T.wav
                                              PROBLEM:
