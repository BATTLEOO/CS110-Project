                                           the running average is not the simple one, the running average should be the cumulative  running average, this part is the main idea of this method
                                           use the running average formular to update the mass of center

                                        2. Create a 2D list of booleans called marked, having the same dimensions as pic
                                           use pic.width() and pic.height() to get col and row, (Notice: make row to width, and col to height)
                                        3. for each col of the image (pic.width())
                                            a) for through each row of the image (pic.height())
                                                i) create a Blob object called blob, we can see this blob as a temporary container
                                                i) call _findBlob() with the appropriate arguments (the method that defined)
                                                i) if statement when blob.mass() > 0 ,  add blob to self._blobs

                                        1. create an empty list to store the value of our beads
                                        2. self._blobs have all the blobs that we found, and we want to count, To know how many beads we have, use for loop to go through self._blobs
                                             a) we call mass (it return pixels to use), we only want the value that is bigger that pixels
                                                 i)add b to add_beads

                                        1. Base case: return if pixel (i, j) is out of bounds, or if it is marked, or if its luminance (use the luminance() method from Color for this) is less than tau.
                                           Can call Color directly because luminance is Static methods: independent of any instance of the class (can be use directly without creating object)
                                        2. marked[i][j], make the current position True
                                        3. call blob add pixel(i , j), to get the new center mass
                                        4.  remember i is column , j is row
                                            when j - 1 means N
                                            self._findBlob(pic, tau,i , j - 1, marked, blob)

                                            when j + 1 means S

                                            when i - 1 means E
                                            self._findBlob(pic, tau, i - 1, j, marked, blob)

                                            when i + 1 means W

Problem 11 (Particle Tracking): def main():
                                    1. create command line arguments pixels(int), tau(float), delta(float)
                                    2. create a frame as empty list in order to store a sequence of image frames
                                       using 4: to include all the input after argument 3, this also help to read the file name
                                    3. Construct a BlobFinder object for the frame and set the picture frame to frames[0]
                                       here is to initial blobs, use BlobFinder on the first frame to identify blobs
                                       frames[0] means the first input in sys.argv[4:]
                                    4. from object_frame get a list of beads prev_beads that have at least pixels(user input)
                                    5.  For each frame starting at sys.argv[5]:
                                        sys.argv[5:] means read all the input after sys.argv[4], sys.argv property is list so can use the slicing method
                                        set for loop to iterate subsequent_frame starting at object_frame
                                            a) Construct a BlobFinder object(blob_detect)  and from it get a list of beads currBeads(store in curr_beads) that have at least pixels
                                            b) for curr_bead in curr_beads
                                                i) use map lambda: it is more clean and organize to use map lambda to calculate a list of prev_beads
                                                i) use the filter to create a one time if statement to find the value x < = delta as a list
                                            c) if closest_distance is ture
                                                i) use min: because closest_distance is list, and we only want one value that is the closest_distance
                                                   the closest_distance means that the smaller the distance is, the closer we are
                                                   so use min to find the value that we want, and min also help to change our data type from list to float
                                                i) write the output in standard format '%.4f\n'
                                            d) Write a newline character
                                            e) Set prevBeads to currBeads (update the curr_beads to prev_beads)

                                                a) read input, assign input to displacement, use stdio.readFloat to check the number one by one
                                                b) covert pixels to meters, use the formular provided (displacements * 0.175e-6)
